# MissIT Canvas
This is just a poor port of Atari's Miss It game. it uses only pure javascript. No frameworks or libraries (for learning purposes).

## Play it now: https://jhonnymichel.github.io/MissIt-canvas/

## Featuring
- ES6 with modules (no transpiling at all. Use the latest version of your browser)
- Canvas
- [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (a nice library to serve static files)

## How to run locally
Run ```NPM Install```, then run ```NPM Start```, then ```http://localhost:8080```.

You better have the latest version of Google Chrome to run this cuz I ain't transpiling the modules to ES5, sorry. let's keep it simple, pals.
